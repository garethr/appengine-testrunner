PyUnit Test runner suitable for use with Google App Engine.
Drop this file into your project directory, create a directory called tests in the same 
directory and create a blank file in that called __init__.py
You directory structure should be something like this:

  - root
    - app.yaml
    - main.py
    - test.py
    - tests
      - __init__.py
    
You should now be able to just drop valid PyUnit test cases into the tests
directory and they should be run when you run test.py via the command line.
